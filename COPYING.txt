## Copying a Raspberry Pi Environment

You can copy the SD card of a working Raspberry Pi to a disk image.
Then you can use the disk image to create working cards for other 
Raspberry Pi devices. This example is for copying on using a Mac.

1. Remove WiFi settings specific to your local network:

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Remove the network object (has WiFi password and other settings)

You may want to remove other settings as well, such as config.js.

2. Remove the SD card from Raspberry Pi and insert into your Mac
(I needed to use an adapter for the micro-sized card).

3. Run the dd utility to create disk image.

Get SD card ID number:

diskutil list

Create disk image based on the number (e.g., 2):

sudo dd if=/dev/rdisk2 of=/temp/rpi_img bs=1m

(Takes 5-10 minutes)

4. Run the dd utility to copy the disk image to new card.

Insert the new SD card and get the ID number:

diskutil list

Unmount the SD card based on number (e.g., 2):

diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2

Copy image to SD card:

sudo dd bs=1m if=/temp/rpi_img of=/dev/rdisk2

(Takes 5-10 minutes)
