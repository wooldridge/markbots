MARKBOT SETUP

Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MV6TAJI

1. Follow instructions in Quick Start Guide to set up Raspbian operating system using NOOBS (New Out of Box Software).

Note: During one setup my SD card was not showing any available space when inserted on the Raspberry Pi, which meant I couldn't install the Raspbian software via NOOBS. I used the adapter that came with the SD card to insert the card into my MacBook Pro. I opened the Mac OS X Disk Tools application and ran the Verify and Repair tools on the SD card. After that, I inserted the SD card back into my Raspberry Pi and this time it showed available space and installation could proceed.

2. Start up the Raspberry Pi (user: pi password: raspberry) and yse the raspi-config tool to do the following:

- Set Internationalisation Options to: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 (there might be a better option since I've had keyboard character issues on my other Raspberry Pi)
- Enable support for Raspberry Pi Camera
- Set boot options to open in GUI as user pi
- Change regional timezone settings

3. To set up Wifi, shut down the Raspberry Pi, insert the USB Wifi adapter, and restart the Raspberry Pi. Then:

Left-click the screen icons in the upper right, select your Wifi network, and enter your Wifi password.

4. Install Node.js v0.10.40 on the Raspberry Pi:

cd /usr/src
sudo wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.40/node-v0.10.40.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf node-v0.10.40.tar.gz
cd node-v0.10.40/
sudo ./configure
# The following takes a long time, an hour or more
sudo make
sudo make install

# confirm node works:
node -v
# should return
v0.10.40

5. Set up access to github

https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

Access to GitHub site features is problematic with the Raspberry Pi browser. I needed to generate my SSH key on the Raspberry Pi and then email to myself. I could then input the key in the GitHub settings via a browser on my Mac.

6. Clone markbots project onto Raspberry Pi:

sudo git clone https://wooldridge@github.com/wooldridge/markbots

7. Set up the Raspberry Pi camera:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md

Plug in the camera with the blue stripe toward Ethernet port.

Run the following as suggested (took a long time, 15 minutes?):

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

To test, run:
raspistill -v -o test.jpg

(Should save an image to the current directory)

8. Set up the GPS receiver:

Plug in the USB-to-TTL serial cable:

http://www.adafruit.com/products/954

https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi/setting-everything-up

Connect cable wires to GPS device:

Red -> VIN
Black -> Grd
Green -> Rx
White -> Tx

Plug the cable into one of the Raspberry Pi's USB ports.

Set up software:

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

To test:

cgps -s

12. Set up PIR motion sensor

13. Install Node.js dependencies. From the markbots directory:

# perform separately, seems to cause problems during full npm install
sudo npm --save install raspi-io

sudo npm install

(Takes a while, 15 minutes)


TEST MARKBOT

cd markbots
sudo chmod 777 *.js
sudo node capture
