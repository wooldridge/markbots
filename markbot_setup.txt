MARKBOT SETUP

Raspberry Pi 2 Model B
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MV6TAJI

1. Follow instructions in Quick Start Guide to set up Raspbian operating system using NOOBS (New Out of Box Software).

Note: Initially, my SD card was not showing any available space when inserted on the Raspberry Pi. I couldn't install the Raspbian software via NOOBS. I used the adapter that came with the SD card to insert the card into my MacBook Pro. I opened the Mac OS X Disk Tools application and ran the Verify and Repair tools on the SD card. After that, I inserted the SD card into my Raspberry Pi and this time it showed available space and I was able to install Raspbian via NOOBS.

2. Use the raspi-config tool to

- Set Internationalisation Options to: en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8 (there might be a better option since I've had keyboard character issues on my other Raspberry Pi)
- Enable support for Raspberry Pi Camera

3. Shutdown the Raspberry Pi, insert the Wifi USB adapter, restart the Raspberry Pi.

4. Reboot the Raspberry Pi.

User: pi
Password: raspberry

Type "startx" and press Enter to start GUI.

Left-click the screen icons in the upper right and select your Wifi network, then enter your Wifi password.


5. Install Node.js v0.10.40

cd /usr/src
sudo wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.40/node-v0.10.40.tar.gz
sudo tar -zxvf node-v0.10.40.tar.gz
cd node-v0.10.40/
sudo ./configure
# sudo make takes a long time, an hour or more
sudo make
sudo make install

# node should now work:
node -v
v0.10.40

6. Set up access to github

https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/

Access to the GitHub site is problematic with the Raspberry Pi browser. I needed to generate my SSH key on the Raspberry Pi, and then email to myself so I could input it in the GitHub settings via a browser on my Mac.

7. Clone markbots project onto Raspberry Pi:

sudo git clone https://wooldridge@github.com/wooldridge/markbots

8. Make GUI load on Raspberry Pi startup:

sudo raspi-config

Set boot options to open in GUI as user pi

9. Change timezone to US Pacific Ocean

sudo raspi-config

Change regional settings

10. Set up camera:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/camera.md

Plug in camera, blue stripe toward Ethernet port.

Ran the follow as suggested (took a long time, 15 minutes?):
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

Run:
raspistill -v -o test.jpg

Should save image to current directory.

11. Set up GPS:

USB to TTL Serial Cable:

https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi/setting-everything-up

connect wires to GPS device, plug into Pi USB port

Red -> VIN
Black -> Grd
Green -> Rx
White -> Tx

sudo apt-get install gpsd gpsd-clients python-gps
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

12. Set up PIR motion sensor

13. Install Node.js dependencies:

in markbots directory:

sudo npm install

(takes a while, 15 minutes)


TEST MARKBOT

cd markbots
sudo chmod 777 *.js
sudo node capture
