Set up Raspberry Pi 2 years after first made MarkBots work.

## GPS Setup

See: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ultimate-gps-on-the-raspberry-pi/setting-everything-up

Had to run the following to get GPS information to show up, via this:
```
sudo systemctl stop gpsd.socket
sudo systemctl disable gpsd.socket
sudo gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock
cgps -s
```
